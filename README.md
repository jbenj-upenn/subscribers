# About

This is a functional API that accepts new users, channels that that have subscribed to, and the date of their subscription. It allows users to be created, viewed, updated, and deleted. 

I followed a tutorial as a refresher course, having already learned about REST APIs in a coding bootcamp that I took earlier this year. 

# Future Development

I would like to combine this with a front end interface like React so that it has an actual GUI and is accessible to users. 

I would also like to add a video that shows the functionality of the API on the back end. I will use Postman to show how it works.

# Credits

I was able to complete this as I followed an online tutorial posted by the youTube user Web Dev Simplified.
